## Pok√©mon Brick Bronze Python Macro üõ†Ô∏è
Pok√©mon Brick Bronze Playing Keybinds for increasing my overall laziness on which I made because I have a bunch of free time to spend.
- Usable on **any Windows device**, in-case you wanna use it too!

Based on **Image Recog. AI**, so it's overall quite _slow_.

> [!NOTE]
> Ignore the [simulate.py](https://github.com/mr-suno/PokemonBB-Playing-Keybinds/blob/main/simulate.py) file! That file is used to fully simulate mouse movements, and **is required** in order to **properly simulate mouse movements** on Roblox.

If you like this project, and wanna support it, **give it a star**! ‚≠ê
- Stars are **very much appreciated** and it helps me not feel horrible about my 300,000th project lol
